## Description

[Super Mario Cape](https://supermariocape.xyz/) is a browser game inspired by _Super Mario World (SNES 1990)_ and _Flappy Bird (Mobile 2013)_. <br>
Zoom past aerial enemies as Caped Mario to collect stars. Complete four hand-designed levels to beat the game.
<br><br>

## Code

We used native JavaScript to implement logic, render images, change styling, and play audio:

- **Object-oriented Programming:** Encapsulation, Composition, and Polymorphism.
- **ES6:** Constants, Scoped Variables, Arrow Functions, Parameter Handling, Template Literals, Object Shorthand, Destructure Assignment, Modules, and Classes.
- **DOM Manipulation:** CSS Styling, Event Listeners, and Creating HTMLElements.
- **Canvas API:** 2D Context, Texture Atlas Drawing, and Sprite Sheet Animations.
  <br><br>

## Tools

- **Adobe Photoshop –** We edited original image assets for higher resolutions and bigger sizes.
- **TexturePacker –** We combined our image assets to a single file to improve game performance.
- **Audacity –** We compressed and clipped soundtracks to reduce game load time.

  <br><br>

## To-do

- [] Redesign levels with new spawner functions and smaller canvas size
- [] Check for redundant style classes for transitions (e.g. #fadeOut.fadeActive)
- [] Add more levels and elements (e.g. coins, structures, powerups)
- [] Improve current import/export pattern
