## Description
[Super Mario Cape]("https://supermariocape.xyz/") is a browser game inspired by _Super Mario World (SNES 1990)_ and _Flappy Bird (Mobile 2013)_. Fly past unique enemies and complete four hand-designed levels to win.
<br><br>

## Code
We used native JavaScript to implement logic, render images, change styling, and play audio:
- **Object-oriented Programming:** Encapsulation, Composition, and Polymorphism.
- **ES6:** Constants, Scoped Variables, Arrow Functions, Parameter Handling, Template Literals, Object Shorthand, Destructure Assignment, Modules, and Classes.
- **DOM Manipulation:** CSS Styling, Event Listeners, and Creating HTMLElements.
- **Canvas API:** 2D Context, Texture Atlas Drawing, and Sprite Sheet Animations.
<br><br>

## Tools
- **Adobe Illustrator –** We traced original image assets for higher image resolutions and bigger sizes.
- **TexturePacker –** We combined our image assets to a single file to improve game performance.
- **Audacity –** We compressed and clipped soundtracks to reduce game load time.
